# ACTAM: Introduction to Version Control Systems

## 20/09/2024

---

## Class outline

- Short introduction (~20 min)
- Short Github demo (~10 min)
- **Hands-on:** Setup and play with first GitHub account (~30 min)

- Coffee/tea (~10 min)

- Short demo using Git (~10 min)
- **Hands-on:** Solo repo (~20 min)
- **Hands-on:** Collab repo (âˆž)

---

## Mindset

- All backgrounds are welcomed! (mine too)
- Collaborative approach
- Having fun == Learning
- Questions shall be asked (llms)  

---

## Magic goals

- To do many things at once (non-linear development)
- To go back in history
- To undo mistakes
- To keep control 

---

## Version/Source control of what?

- Folders, documents, codebases...a song?
- Markdown!

---

# This
## is
### the markdown syntax
_for code snippets:_
```
console.log("I love markdown")
```

## Types of version control

### Local
- Based on a simple database that kept track of all the changes in the files
- No collaboration: **Bad**

---

---

## Types of version control

### Centralized
- A single server that contains all the versioned files
- Entire history of the project in a single place: **bad**

---

---

## Types of version control

### Distributed (e.g Git)
- Versioned fileses are stored at different places
- Any of the client repos can be copied back up to the server to restore it: **good**

## Many Git powers to achieve magic goals

- **start a working area:** *git add* | *git clone*

- **mess around:** *git add* | *git mv* | *git rm*

- **examine history and state:** *git status* | *git log* | *git diff*

- **make and modify history:** *git commit* | *git branch* | *git merge*

- **collaborate:** *git fetch* | *git pull* | *git push*

---

## Memo 1: Adding vs Committing

- *git add*: stages changes (new, modified, or deleted files) in the **staging area** preparing them for a commit
- *git commit*: records the staged changes into the repo's history, creating **a snapshot of the current state** of the project.

---

## Memo 2: Fetching vs Pulling

- *git fetch*: retrieves updates from a remote repo **without altering the local working directory**
- *git pull*:  retrieves updates from a remote repo and then **integrate with another repo or a local branch**

---

## Memo 3: Pull request (PR) vs Merge request (MR)

Almost synonim across github and gitlab.

**A PR is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another, reviewed by team members**
